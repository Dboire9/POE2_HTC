## 1. `AlternativesView` disappears silently on an empty result

`src/features/engine/AlternativesView.tsx:117` is `if (alts.rows.length === 0) return null`. Set a
budget too low and the panel is simply absent — no "nothing fits 5ex". Small fix.

## 2. Mobile layout

`EngineLab.tsx:491` is a bare `flex gap-4` for the prefix/suffix mod columns — it never stacks, so
both are crushed on a phone. (The `hidden md:flex` header block is only the credit and Discord links;
cosmetic, low priority.)

## 3. Jargon pass

"Pareto frontier", "plans evaluated", "search capped", and a budget in "ex" whose unit appears only in
a `title` attribute. Decide what a player who has never read the source would call these.

## 4. Startup cost

`mods.json` preload, code-splitting, unused UI kit components, memoising the mod lists.

- **One essence modifier per item, and Lab support for perfect essences** (2026-08-22). Nothing capped
  the essence count: `fromItem.ts` built one `perfect-essence` op per perfect target, the MDP gave each
  its own action, and `optimize.ts` counted only `source: 'essence'` — so all three would plan an item
  carrying two essence modifiers, which the game forbids. `isEssenceMod` is now the single predicate
  they all count with. The Lab also lists perfect essences and plans them from white by sacrificing a
  placed mod and re-adding it with an Exalt. Fixed alongside: the perfect-essence path had **no
  item-level gate** at all (every such mod is ilvl 72).

- **Copy-audit rows 3, 4, 5, 6** (2026-08-22). The empty-frontier fallback no longer tells players the
  target is impossible; the two error headers name the planner; the from-item panel says which of its
  two cost models is the optimistic one. `FrontierView.test.tsx` pins the empty state.

- **Armour desecration in Item mode** (2026-08-22). The MDP gated every desecrate action behind a boss
  omen, so armour — 342 of 527 desecrated mods — reported `feasible: false` for a craft the game
  performs happily. `markovActions.ts` now offers the untargeted draw (weighted over the combined
  normal ∪ desecrated pool, mirroring `desecrationProbability`) on every base, with the boss variants
  layered on top only where the omen is legal. It also restores desecration for a player who has
  excluded every omen, which was broken on weapons too.

- Desecration empty state told players a legal filler → annul → Desecrate route was impossible (2026-08-22).
- Price line rendered as broken English when the sheet's caveat became a full sentence (2026-08-22).
- Boss omens gated to Weapon/Jewellery bases — they were being planned on armour, where the game
  refuses them (2026-08-22). The follow-on is the item above.
