## 1. Armour desecration: 6-8s, and value iteration never converges

Measured on `Body_Armours_dex_int`, one rollable + one desecrated target at ilvl 82:

| base | total | actions | value iteration | converged? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wands | 46 ms | 18 ms | 46 ms | yes |
| Body_Armours_dex_int | **6014 ms** | 12 ms | **6014 ms** | **no — 100,000 sweeps, the cap** |

Inherent, not a coding bug. Confirmed with the user 2026-08-23: an unomened bone draws from the
combined normal ∪ desecrated pool by weight, so landing one specific armour mod is **1 in 121,510**,
and VI's convergence rate is governed by that probability.

Handled for now by reporting it (`MarkovResult.converged`; the UI shows "≥ x" and says the number is a
floor) rather than hiding it. Two open questions:

- **The progress bar sits at ~92% for five seconds.** The solve phase reports `0/11 → 1/11` across the
  whole run — the decade-based measure has almost no resolution when convergence is this slow.
- **Should a hopeless craft short-circuit?** The user declined an early exit once; worth revisiting now
  that we know the number is a floor and not an answer.

## 2. Startup: what measurement left on the table

Done: `mods.json` warm-start, immutable cache headers, dead UI kit removed. What the bundle
visualiser (`ANALYZE=1 npm run build`) showed, as a share of the 108.7 kB gzip bundle:

| share | package |
|---|---|
| 51% | react-dom |
| 21% | app source |
| 8.8% | tailwind-merge |
| 6.9% | sonner |
| 6.9% | @sentry/* (all three packages combined) |

(Per-module gzip sums overcount, since each is compressed alone — read these as shares, not bytes.)

Two things worth a look, neither obviously worth it:

- **tailwind-merge at 8.8%** is a lot for merging class strings. It is used only by the `cn()` helper.
  If nothing actually relies on conflict resolution, `clsx` alone would do — but swapping it risks
  quiet style breakage, so it needs a real audit of `cn()` call sites first.
- **react-dom is half the bundle** and irreducible without changing framework. Not worth it.

Sentry was the hypothesis going in and the measurement killed it: ~6.9% across all three packages,
Session Replay not in the bundle at all. Lazy-loading it would buy almost nothing.

## Recently closed

- **The MDP silently returned unconverged numbers** (2026-08-23). Value iteration bails at
  `maxIters` (100k) on long-odds crafts, and because VI 0-initialises and climbs, the value it returns
  is a strict LOWER BOUND. Nothing said so — `expectedCost` came back looking like an estimate and the
  UI printed it as a plain figure. `MarkovResult.converged` now carries it end to end, and the panel
  renders "≥ x" with a note that the real cost may be far higher.

- **The silent alternatives panel, and mobile mod columns** (2026-08-22). `AlternativesView` returned
  `null` on an empty frontier, so it just wasn't there — and an existing test asserted
  `toBeEmptyDOMElement()`, pinning the bug as intended behaviour. It now explains itself. Note the
  entry in this list previously claimed a low budget caused it; that was **wrong**. Row 0 is the exact
  target and enters with `bestP = -Infinity`, so it survives at any odds — verified at a budget of
  0.0001 ex. Rows only run out when every variant tried was unplannable, which is about the base and
  item level. The message says so rather than blaming the budget.
  Also: the prefix/suffix mod columns in both the Lab and the item builder were a bare `flex gap-4`
  that never stacked, crushing the mod text on a phone. Now `flex flex-col sm:flex-row`.

- **One essence modifier per item, and Lab support for perfect essences** (2026-08-22). Nothing capped
  the essence count: `fromItem.ts` built one `perfect-essence` op per perfect target, the MDP gave each
  its own action, and `optimize.ts` counted only `source: 'essence'` — so all three would plan an item
  carrying two essence modifiers, which the game forbids. `isEssenceMod` is now the single predicate
  they all count with. The Lab also lists perfect essences and plans them from white by sacrificing a
  placed mod and re-adding it with an Exalt. Fixed alongside: the perfect-essence path had **no
  item-level gate** at all (every such mod is ilvl 72).

- **Copy-audit rows 3, 4, 5, 6** (2026-08-22). The empty-frontier fallback no longer tells players the
  target is impossible; the two error headers name the planner; the from-item panel says which of its
  two cost models is the optimistic one. `FrontierView.test.tsx` pins the empty state.

- **Armour desecration in Item mode** (2026-08-22). The MDP gated every desecrate action behind a boss
  omen, so armour — 342 of 527 desecrated mods — reported `feasible: false` for a craft the game
  performs happily. `markovActions.ts` now offers the untargeted draw (weighted over the combined
  normal ∪ desecrated pool, mirroring `desecrationProbability`) on every base, with the boss variants
  layered on top only where the omen is legal. It also restores desecration for a player who has
  excluded every omen, which was broken on weapons too.

- Desecration empty state told players a legal filler → annul → Desecrate route was impossible (2026-08-22).
- Price line rendered as broken English when the sheet's caveat became a full sentence (2026-08-22).
- Boss omens gated to Weapon/Jewellery bases — they were being planned on armour, where the game
  refuses them (2026-08-22). The follow-on is the item above.
