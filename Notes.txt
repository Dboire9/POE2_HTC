Issues : 

	- Desecration : 
		- Because we do not know the weight of desecrated modifiers, i decided to not include them when desecrating normally without omens, so normal desecration are like an exalted orb, but the percentage is divided by 3 in the calculus because you have 3 choices(* will be when i do the algo).
		So the percentage might be a bit skewed because of this. 
		Handling the Mark of the Abyss is missing

Missing omens to add whittling

For the algorithm, check the potential max count the item can have for Magic or early Rare, and build from it
For Heuristic, would be good if 6 mods item done = 60 000
1 modifier = 10 000 

At the beginning, start with 6 bases with one desired modifier, because we wil always have at least one modifier of the final item at first (?)



What to do : 



-Separate each step by modifiers
-Make it so that we have at max 12 steps (for using 6 annuls max)
-Cannot use 2 annuls back to back (?) or without an omen (?)
-Cannot use annuls without omens (?)
-If the item has slot full, only use annuls or annuls related omens
-On magic items, reduce essence to the desired modifier or essence that has a family tag
-On normal item, start with the desired modifier or a modifier that has the same family tag (?)




- Rng for tier of currency : done

-On magic items, first step should be apply augmentation (or not), then apply omen for essence or regal (or not) : DONE
-if omens for essence, only apply one of the two and then apply the essence (the omens are not compatible) : DONE
-if omen for regal, apply the regal just after : DONE
